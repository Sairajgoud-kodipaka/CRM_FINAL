# Dashboard Date Filtering Fix - Missing End Date Conditions

## Problem Identified
The dashboard was showing "0 customers" and "₹0 revenue" for October 2025, even though the database contains:
- **26 customers** created in October 2025
- **1 sale** worth ₹1,275,150 created on October 6, 2025

## Root Cause
The API was missing `created_at__lte=end_date` conditions in several database queries. The queries were only filtering by `created_at__gte=start_date` but not by the end date, causing them to return data from the start date onwards (including future dates) instead of the specific date range.

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **Revenue Calculation**
```python
# BEFORE - Missing end_date condition
current_revenue = Sale.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
).aggregate(total=Sum('total_amount'))['total'] or 0

# AFTER - Includes end_date condition
current_revenue = Sale.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    created_at__lte=end_date,  # ← ADDED THIS
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
).aggregate(total=Sum('total_amount'))['total'] or 0
```

### ✅ **Store Performance**
```python
# BEFORE - Missing end_date condition
store_sales = Sale.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
)

# AFTER - Includes end_date condition
store_sales = Sale.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    created_at__lte=end_date,  # ← ADDED THIS
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
)
```

### ✅ **Store Customers**
```python
# BEFORE - Missing end_date condition
store_customers = Client.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    is_deleted=False
).count()

# AFTER - Includes end_date condition
store_customers = Client.objects.filter(
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    created_at__lte=end_date,  # ← ADDED THIS
    is_deleted=False
).count()
```

### ✅ **Team Performance**
```python
# BEFORE - Missing end_date condition
member_sales = Sale.objects.filter(
    sales_representative=member.id,
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
)

member_customers = Client.objects.filter(
    assigned_to=member.id,
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    is_deleted=False
).count()

# AFTER - Includes end_date condition
member_sales = Sale.objects.filter(
    sales_representative=member.id,
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    created_at__lte=end_date,  # ← ADDED THIS
    status__in=['confirmed', 'delivered']
)

member_customers = Client.objects.filter(
    assigned_to=member.id,
    created_at__gte=start_date,
    created_at__lte=end_date,  # ← ADDED THIS
    is_deleted=False
).count()
```

## Expected Results Now

### **October 2025 Dashboard Should Show:**
- **Monthly Sales**: 1 sale (₹1,275,150 revenue)
- **New Customers**: 26 customers
- **Store Performance**: Actual revenue and customer counts for October
- **Top Performers**: Actual performance data for October

### **Any Date Range Should Show:**
- Accurate data for the specific selected period
- No data bleeding from outside the date range
- Consistent filtering across all metrics

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The dashboard API now properly filters all data by both start and end dates. When you select October 2025, you should now see your 26 customers and 1 sale that were created from October 6-10!
