# Sales Customers Date Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified
The sales customers page date filter was not working. When selecting "Sep 01 - Sep 30, 2025", the page was still showing customers created on "10/10/2025" and "9/10/2025" (October 2025).

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Frontend Issue**
The `fetchCustomers` function was missing `dateRange` in its `useCallback` dependency array:
```typescript
// BEFORE - Missing dateRange dependency
const fetchCustomers = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... function body
}, [userScope.type, toast]);

// AFTER - Includes dateRange dependency  
const fetchCustomers = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... function body
}, [userScope.type, toast, dateRange]);
```

### **Backend Issue**
The `GlobalDateFilterMixin` was expecting a `date_filter` attribute on the request object, but the frontend was sending `start_date` and `end_date` as query parameters. The mixin wasn't reading the query parameters directly.

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ **Frontend Fix**
- Added `dateRange` to the `useCallback` dependency array
- This ensures the `fetchCustomers` function is recreated when the date range changes
- The `useEffect` will now trigger when `dateRange` changes

### ✅ **Backend Fix - GlobalDateFilterMixin**
Updated the mixin to read query parameters directly:

```python
# BEFORE - Expected request.date_filter attribute
if not hasattr(self.request, 'date_filter') or not self.request.date_filter.get('enabled', False):
    return queryset

# AFTER - Reads query parameters directly
start_date_param = self.request.query_params.get('start_date')
end_date_param = self.request.query_params.get('end_date')

if not start_date_param or not end_date_param:
    return queryset
```

### ✅ **Date Parsing Enhancement**
Added proper handling of ISO datetime strings:
```python
# Handle ISO datetime strings by extracting just the date part
if 'T' in start_date_param:
    start_date_param = start_date_param.split('T')[0]
if 'T' in end_date_param:
    end_date_param = end_date_param.split('T')[0]

start_date = datetime.strptime(start_date_param, '%Y-%m-%d').replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
end_date = datetime.strptime(end_date_param, '%Y-%m-%d').replace(hour=23, minute=59, second=59, microsecond=999999)
```

## Expected Results

### **Sales Customers Page Should Now:**
- ✅ Filter customers by the selected date range
- ✅ Show only customers created within the selected period
- ✅ Update automatically when date range changes
- ✅ Handle both ISO datetime and regular date formats

### **When You Select September 2025:**
- Should show only customers created in September 2025
- Should NOT show customers from October 2025
- Should update the customer count and list accordingly

## Impact on Other Pages
This fix also improves date filtering across all pages that use `GlobalDateFilterMixin`:
- ✅ Sales Pipeline
- ✅ Appointments  
- ✅ All other customer pages
- ✅ Any other views using the mixin

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The sales customers page date filtering should now work correctly. When you select September 2025, you should only see customers created in that month!
