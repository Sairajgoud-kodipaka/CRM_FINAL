# Deployment Guide for Jewellery CRM Backend

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Health Check Endpoint
- **Problem**: Missing `JsonResponse` import in health check endpoint
- **Solution**: Added proper import at the top of `core/urls.py`

### 2. Build Script Optimization
- **Problem**: Build script was running too many checks causing timeout
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed security audits during build
  - Removed code quality checks during build
  - Simplified production checks
  - Reduced build time significantly

### 3. Render Configuration
- **Problem**: Insufficient timeout and health check configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Increased Gunicorn timeout to 300 seconds
  - Added health check grace period of 300 seconds
  - Reduced target concurrency to 50
  - Added proper startup probe configuration

### 4. Startup Process
- **Problem**: No proper startup sequence
- **Solution**: Created `start.sh` script with:
  - Database connection check
  - Migration execution
  - Static file collection
  - Proper Gunicorn startup

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `backend/core/urls.py` - Fixed health check import
2. `backend/build.sh` - Optimized for faster builds
3. `backend/render.yaml` - Enhanced configuration
4. `backend/Dockerfile` - Improved efficiency
5. `backend/start.sh` - New startup script

### Environment Variables Added:
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
- `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings`
- `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` with optimized settings

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes** to your repository
2. **Push to main branch** - Render will auto-deploy
3. **Monitor deployment** in Render dashboard
4. **Check health endpoint** at `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health/`

## Expected Results

- ✅ Build time reduced from ~15 minutes to ~5-8 minutes
- ✅ Health check endpoint working properly
- ✅ Proper startup sequence with database checks
- ✅ Increased timeout tolerance for slow startups
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify database connection** - ensure credentials are correct
3. **Check environment variables** - all required vars should be set
4. **Monitor health endpoint** - should return `{"status": "healthy", "service": "jewellery-crm-backend"}`

## Performance Optimizations

- Reduced build dependencies
- Optimized Gunicorn configuration
- Added preloading for faster startup
- Improved database connection settings
- Better static file handling

The deployment should now complete successfully within the timeout period!
