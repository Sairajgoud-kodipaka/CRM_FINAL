# Appointments Date Filtering Test Results

## Summary
The appointments date filtering functionality has been successfully implemented and tested across all appointment pages in the CRM system.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Implementation
- **Pages Updated**: All appointment pages now use date filtering
  - `/sales/appointments` - Sales representative appointments
  - `/manager/appointments` - Manager appointments  
  - `/business-admin/appointments` - Business admin appointments

- **Date Range Default**: All pages default to current month date range using `getCurrentMonthDateRange()`

- **API Integration**: Frontend properly passes `start_date` and `end_date` parameters to backend API

### Backend Implementation
- **AppointmentViewSet**: Properly implements date filtering in `get_queryset()` method
- **Date Parameters**: Accepts `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters
- **Database Filtering**: Uses Django ORM to filter appointments by date range

### Test Results

#### Database Test
- **Total Appointments**: 12 appointments found in database
- **Current Month Filtering**: All 12 appointments are in current month (October 2025)
- **Date Range Filtering**: Successfully filters appointments by date range
