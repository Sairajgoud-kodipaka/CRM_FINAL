## **📈 EXPECTED IMPACT**

**After fixing all 67 endpoints:**
- ✅ **Customer creation will work** (no more 404 errors)
- ✅ **Store creation will work** (already fixed)
- ✅ **Product management will work**
- ✅ **Team management will work**
- ✅ **Appointments will work**
- ✅ **Support system will work**
- ✅ **Notifications will work**
- ✅ **Reduced 404/405 errors by 90%+**

---

## **🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Total broken endpoints:** 67
**Critical endpoints:** 49
**Medium priority:** 18

**This is a SYSTEMIC ISSUE** that requires immediate attention. The current state means:
- ❌ **67 out of ~100 API calls are failing**
- ❌ **Core business functions are broken**
- ❌ **User experience is severely degraded**
- ❌ **404/405 errors are rampant**

**Recommendation:** Fix ALL endpoints in one comprehensive update rather than piecemeal fixes.
