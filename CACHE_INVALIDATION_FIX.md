# Cache Invalidation Fix - Resolving Hard Refresh Issues

## Problem Summary

Multiple pages in the business admin section required hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see updated data after creating/editing/deleting stores or team members.

### Affected Pages (Count: 6+)
1. `/business-admin/settings/team` - Team management page
2. `/business-admin/settings/stores` - Store settings page  
3. `/business-admin/purchases` - Purchases page
4. `/manager/team` - Manager team page
5. Pages using `getStores()` or `listTeamMembers()` API calls
6. Any component fetching store or team member data

## Root Cause

The `api-service.ts` has a client-side cache with 2-minute TTL to improve performance. However:

### The Issue:
- ‚úÖ GET requests were cached (worked great for performance)
- ‚ùå POST/PUT/DELETE mutations did NOT invalidate related caches
- ‚ùå When creating a store, cache entries for `/stores/` and `/users/team-members/` were not cleared
- ‚ùå Other pages continued showing stale cached data until manual hard refresh

### Why It Happened:
```typescript
// BEFORE - Store creation didn't clear cache
async createStore(storeData: Partial<Store>): Promise<ApiResponse<Store>> {
  return this.request('/stores/', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(storeData),
  });
  // ‚ùå Cache for '/stores/' still contains old data!
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### What We Fixed:
Added cache invalidation to all store and team member mutation methods in `api-service.ts`:

#### 1. Store Operations:
- `createStore()` - Now invalidates `/stores/`, `/users/team-members/`, `/users/`
- `updateStore()` - Now invalidates specific store cache + all stores list
- `deleteStore()` - Now invalidates deleted store + all stores list

#### 2. Team Member Operations:
- `createTeamMember()` - Now invalidates team members, users, and stores caches
- `updateTeamMember()` - Now invalidates specific member + all team members list
- `deleteTeamMember()` - Now invalidates deleted member + all team members list

### How It Works Now:
```typescript
// AFTER - Store creation now clears related caches
async createStore(storeData: Partial<Store>): Promise<ApiResponse<Store>> {
  const response = await this.request('/stores/', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(storeData),
  });
  
  // ‚úÖ Invalidate cache for stores and related data
  if (response.success) {
    this.invalidateCache(['/stores/', '/users/team-members/', '/users/']);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

## Benefits

### Before Fix:
‚ùå User creates store ‚Üí Other pages show old store list  
‚ùå User edits team member ‚Üí Store assignment dropdown shows stale data  
‚ùå User needs to manually refresh every page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### After Fix:
‚úÖ User creates store ‚Üí All pages immediately show new store  
‚úÖ User edits team member ‚Üí All dropdowns update automatically  
‚úÖ No manual refresh needed - data syncs across all pages  

## Technical Details

### Cache Invalidation Logic:
```typescript
// Pattern-based cache clearing
private invalidateCache(pattern: string | string[]): void {
  const patterns = Array.isArray(pattern) ? pattern : [pattern];
  const keysToInvalidate: string[] = [];
  
  for (const [key] of this.cache) {
    if (patterns.some(p => key.includes(p))) {
      keysToInvalidate.push(key);
      this.cache.delete(key);
    }
  }
  
  if (keysToInvalidate.length > 0) {
    console.log('üîÑ Cache invalidated:', patterns, keysToInvalidate.length, 'keys');
  }
}
```

### Related Cache Keys Cleared:
- **Store mutations** invalidate:
  - `/stores/` - All stores list
  - `/stores/{id}/` - Specific store details
  - `/users/team-members/` - Team members (may have store assignments)
  - `/users/` - All users (some may be assigned to stores)

- **Team member mutations** invalidate:
  - `/users/team-members/` - All team members
  - `/users/team-members/{id}/` - Specific member
  - `/users/` - All users list
  - `/stores/` - Stores (may have team assignments shown)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:
1. ‚úÖ Create store ‚Üí Check all pages show new store without refresh
2. ‚úÖ Edit store ‚Üí Check updates appear immediately
3. ‚úÖ Delete store ‚Üí Check it disappears from all pages
4. ‚úÖ Create team member ‚Üí Check appears in all team lists
5. ‚úÖ Edit team member ‚Üí Check updates reflect everywhere
6. ‚úÖ Delete team member ‚Üí Check removed from all lists

### Pages to Verify:
- `/business-admin/settings/stores` - Stores list
- `/business-admin/settings/team` - Team members list
- `/business-admin/purchases` - Store filter dropdown
- Any page with store or team member dropdowns

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Impact:
- Cache invalidation is O(n) where n = number of cache entries
- Typical cache size: ~50-100 entries (negligible)
- Cache TTL is still 2 minutes (balancing freshness vs performance)
- Only invalidates on successful mutations (failures don't clear cache)

## Files Modified

1. `jewellery-crm/src/lib/api-service.ts` (Lines ~1650-1690, 1805-1840)
   - Added cache invalidation to 6 methods
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - No breaking changes

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the hard refresh requirement for store and team member data. Users can now create, edit, and delete data with immediate visibility across all pages without manual refreshes.
